All sectors of the indusrty will need to rapidly expand sustainably to meet the protein demands of our growing global population. The one remaining constraint to the sustainable scale-up of many aquacultured species is their reliance on wild-sourced fishmeal and fish oil as feed ingredients. Many aquacultured species are carnivorous, requiring diets high in proteins and oils, which are most easily supplied through wild fishery ingredients. However, reliance on naturally limited wild fish stocks for fishmeal and fish oil is not only unsustainable but presents a bottleneck in growth of the aquaculture industry; alternative must be found.',
